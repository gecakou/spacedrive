/// The practice of dividing files into hex coded folders, often called "sharding," is mainly used to optimize file system performance. File systems can start to slow down as the number of files in a directory increases. Thus, it's often beneficial to split files into multiple directories to avoid this performance degradation.

/// `calc_shard_hex` takes a cas_id as input, computes a blake3 hash of the cas_id, and returns the first two characters of the hash as the directory name. Because we're using the first two characters of a blake3 hash, this will give us 256 (16*16) possible directories, named 00 to ff.
