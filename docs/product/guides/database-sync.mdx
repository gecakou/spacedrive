# Database Sync

Spacedrive Libraries are just databases shared among multiple instances. When these instances connect, either via Spacedrive Cloud or peer-to-peer, the changes to each instance's local database are synchronized.
The technical details of this process are covered in the [Developer docs](/docs/developers/architecture/sync).

## Cloud Sync

When connected to Spacedrive Cloud, a Spacedrive Instance will send its changes to be stored in the Cloud in an encrypted format.
When another instance connects to the Cloud, it will download these changes and apply them to its local database.

This process does not require multiple instances to be connected at the same time.
Spacedrive Cloud will store the changes for when other instances connect.

## Peer-To-Peer Sync

When connected over peer-to-peer, two instances will exchange their database changess directly.
The contents of the database changes are not encrypted themselves,
instead the connection between the two instances will ensure that they are encrypted during transit.
