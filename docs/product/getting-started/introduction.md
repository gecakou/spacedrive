# Welcome to Spacedrive

Spacedrive is a cross-platform open source file manager. It connects your devices together into one filesystem to organize your files from anywhere, without them even being online at the time.

Beyond being an opinionated, swiss army knife file explorer, Spacedrive is a personal database. It identifies your files uniquely, categorizing them as Objects, understanding more file types than any operating system.

Create photo albums that you'll never loose, effortlessly catalogue terabytes of video, move files between devices dynamically to optimize space and redundancy, generate preview media to optimize viewing, automate security and encryptionâ€”the list goes on.
