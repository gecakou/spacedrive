# Terminology

Some useful Spacedrive related terminology.

### `Library`

A Library is the database that powers Spacedrive, all metadata and directory structures are saved in the Library. Libraries can be synced between devices and a user can have multiple libraries loaded in the Spacedrive app at once. [Learn more →](/docs/developers/architecture/libraries)

### `Object`

Objects are a fancy name for files, we call them Objects because we identify them uniquely based on a cryptographic hash of the contents. Objects in Spacedrive can come in a wide variety of kinds to provide a broad range of context. [Learn more →](/docs/developers/architecture/objects)

### `Location`

Locations are places Spacedrive will look for files, usually a directory on a mounted volume, but could also be a cloud service. [Learn more →](/docs/developers/architecture/locations)

### `Node`

A Node is a device or server running the Spacedrive core. Nodes can host libraries and communicate with other Nodes to sync data. [Learn more →](/docs/developers/architecture/nodes)

### `Preview Media`

Preview media refers to highly compressed image or video content for an Object, it is generated by Spacedrive and synced between your devices. [Learn more →](/docs/developers/architecture/preview-media)
