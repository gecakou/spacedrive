After \_\_ months of development we are extremely excited to be releasing the first version of Spacedrive as an early public beta.

This is an MVP, and by no means feature complete. Please test out the features listed below and give us feedback via Discord, email or GitHub Issues :D

This release is missing database synchronization between nodes (your devices), for now this renders connecting nodes useless, other than to transfer individual files. But don't worry, its coming very soon!

_Features:_

- Support for Windows, Linux and macOS, iOS and Android.

- Basic onboarding flow, determine use-case and preferences.

- Create [Libraries](../../developers/architecture/libraries) and switch between them.

- Connect multiple [Nodes](../../developers/architecture/nodes) to a Library via LAN.

- Add [Locations](../../developers/architecture/locations) to import files into Spacedrive.

  - Indexer watch for changes and performs light re-scans.

  - Identifier generates checksum and categorizes files into [Objects]()

  - Define rules for indexer to ignore certain files or folders.

    _Eventually Clouds will be supported and added as Cloud Locations_

- Browse Locations via the [Explorer](../../developers/architecture/explorer) and view previews and metadata.
  - Viewer options: row/grid item size, gap adjustment, show/hide info.
  - Context menu: rename, copy, duplicate, delete, favorite and add tags.
  - Multi-select with dedicated context menu options.
  - Open with default OS app, in-app viewer (images/text only) or Apple Quicklook

- Generate [Preview Media](../../developers/architecture/preview-media) for image, video and text.

- Create [Tags](../../developers/architecture/tags) and assign them to files, browse Tags in the Explorer.

- Create [Spaces](../../developers/architecture/spaces) to organize and present files.

  - Automated Spaces can include files that match criteria.

    _Eventually Spaces will be sharable, publically or privately_

- Create photo [Albums](../../developers/architecture/albums) and add images.

- Library statistics: total capacity, database size, preview media size, free space.

- [Search](../../developers/architecture/search) Library via search bar or CTRL+F.
