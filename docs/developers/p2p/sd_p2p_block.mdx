# `sd_p2p_block`

[Implementation](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/tree/main/crates/p2p/crates/block)

A file block protocol based on [SyncThing Block Exchange Protocol v1](https://docs.syncthing.net/specs/bep-v1.html).

The goal of this protocol is to take bytes in and reliabily and quickly transfer them to the other side.

## Example

```rs
# TODO
```
