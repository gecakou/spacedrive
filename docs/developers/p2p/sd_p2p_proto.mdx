# `sd_p2p_proto`

[Implementation](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/tree/main/crates/p2p/crates/proto)

This crate provides utilities for implementing asynchronous deserializers and matching synchronous serializers. The goal of these implementations is to rapidly send and receive Rust structs over the network.

This crate allows for creating implementations faster than other common options, at the cost of some developer experience.

Before building, the performance of both [msgpack](https://docs.rs/rmp-serde) and [bincode](https://docs.rs/bincode) was compared against manual implementations using `AsyncRead`. It was found that over the network using asynchronous deserialization was faster.

This logically follows as if you want to use a synchronous serializer, you will do the following:

 - Send the total length of the message
 - Allocate a buffer for the message
 - Wait asynchronously for the buffer to be filled
 - Synchronously copy from the buffer into each of the struct fields

When using an asynchronous serializer you can skip sending the messages length and allocating the intermediate buffer as we can rely on the known length of each field while decoding - this is a win for performance and memory usage.

This crate provides utilities to make the implementations less error prone. However, long term it would be great to replace this with a derive macro similar to how crates like [serde](https://serde.rs) work.

From my research no crate exists that meets these requirements. It is also a difficult problem because your juggling lifetimes and async which is rough. I attempted an implementation called [binario](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/binario), however it is still incomplete so we never adopted it. I suspect Rust's recent stablisation of [RPITIT](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/12/21/async-fn-rpit-in-traits.html) would make this much easier.

This issued is tracked as [ENG-431](https://linear.app/spacedriveapp/issue/ENG-431/binary-handling-abstraction).
