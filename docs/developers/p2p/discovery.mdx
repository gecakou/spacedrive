### Manual connection

The user can manually provide a set of [`SocketAddr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.SocketAddr.html)'s and the P2P system to attempt to connect to.

This feature primarily exists for usage in combination with Docker but it could be useful for working around difficult network setups.
