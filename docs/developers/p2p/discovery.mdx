# Discovery

Discovery is the process of finding other nodes to connect with.

We do this through the following 3 systems:
 - Manual entry by the user
 - [Local Network Discovery](/docs/developers/p2p/local-network-discovery) via mDNS
 - [Relay](/docs/developers/p2p/relay) via mDNS

## Manually provided

The user can manually provide a set of [`SocketAddr`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/net/enum.SocketAddr.html)'s and the P2P system to attempt to connect to.

This feature primarily exists for usage in combination with Docker but it could be useful for working around difficult network setups.

TODO - Explain why manual discovery don't show up under nodes. -> It's cause no peer ID and metadata. I think this is a mistake.
