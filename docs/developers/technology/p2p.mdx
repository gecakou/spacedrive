# Peer-to-peer

Our peer-to-peer technology works at the heart of Spacedrive allowing all of your devices to seamlessly communicate and share data. This documentation outlines

## Implementing features with P2P

TODO - From frontend, to backend, including authentication

## Underlying technology

### Local Network Discovery

Our local network discovery uses [DNS-Based Service Discovery](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6763.html) which itself is built around [Multicast DNS (mDNS)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6762). This is a really well established technology and is used in [Spotify Connect](https://support.spotify.com/au/article/spotify-connect/), [Apple Airplay](https://www.apple.com/au/airplay/) and many other services you use every day.

#### Service structure

The following is an example of what would be broadcast from a single Spacedrive node:
```toml
# {remote_identity_of_self}._sd._udp.local.

name=Oscars Laptop        # Shown to the user to select a device
operating_system=macos    # Used for UI purposes
device_model=MacBook Pro  # Used for UI purposes
version=0.0.1 						# Spacedrive version

# For each library that's active on the Spacedrive node:
# {library_uuid}={remote_identity_of_self}
d66ed0c3-03ac-4f9b-a374-a927830dfd5b=0l9vTOWu+5aJs0cyWxdfJEGtloEepGRAXcEuDeTDRPk
```

Within `sd-core` this is defined in two parts. The [`PeerMetadata` struct](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/blob/44478207e72495b3777e294660d78939711b544f/core/src/p2p/metadata.rs#L9) takes care of the node metadata and libraries are inserted by the [`libraries_hook`](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/blob/44478207e72495b3777e294660d78939711b544f/core/src/p2p/libraries.rs#L13).

#### Modes

<Notice
	type="note"
	text="This section discusses 'Contacts Only' which is not yet fully implemented."
/>

Within Spacedrive's settings the user is able to choose between three modes for local network discovery:
 - **Contacts only**: Only devices that are in your contacts list will be able to see your device.
 - **Enabled**: All devices on the local network will be able to see your device.
 - **Disabled**: No devices on the local network will be able to see your device.

**Contacts only** the mDNS records will be encrypted with a random





{/* If a match is found, the receiving device responds over peer-to-peer Wi-Fi with its identity information. If there is no match, the device doesn’t respond. */}





TODO - Explain contacts only, enabled, disabled thing

#### Rust implementation

We make use of the [mdns-sd](https://docs.rs/mdns-sd) crate.

TODO - Explain crate bit

TODO - mDNS and services



### Manual connection

TODO - TODO

### Relay

TODO

### Direction Connect via Relay

TODO


### Design Decisions

TODO

### Things I would do differently?

TODO

### Crates

TODO

#### Security

##### Threat model

TODO - Risks of sharing IP's using discovery, risks of compromised relay, risks of compromised local network during pairing

##### Authentication

TODO

##### Authorization

TODO

##### Tracking

TODO - Link to Apple stuff


TODO - `RemoteIdentity` vs `Identity` vs `PeerId`

TODO - Rust structure, core crate, features built around it.
TODO - Explain hooks and listeners
TODO - Block protocol + serializer crate (why async serializer and why a general crate abstraction is hard)
	TODO - Maybe open source and link - https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/binario
TODO - Why libp2p fork?, Why libp2p can be problematic for what we do
TODO - How we transpose our certificates to libp2p certificates
TODO - Compatibility across versions of Spacedrive

#### Major issues

TODO - mDNS issues on Linux
TODO - The double up of service discovery when using local and relay

TODO - Question? Why does remote_identity_of_self show up in metadata and the mDNS record itself.

#### Docs issues

TODO - Code snippets don't render as links, cringe
TODO - Making non-uppercase pages is annoying
