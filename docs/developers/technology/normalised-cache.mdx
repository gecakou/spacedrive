# Normalised Cache

We use a normalised cache for our frontend to ensure the UI will always contain consistent data.

## What this system does?

By normalising the data it's impossible to get "state tearing".

Each time `useNodes` or `cache.withNodes` is called all `useCache` hooks will reexecute if they depend on a node that has changed.

This means the queries will always render the newest version of the model.

## Terminology

 - `CacheNode`: A node in the cache - this contains the data and can be identified by the model's name and unique ID within the data (eg. database primary key).
 - `Reference<T>`: A reference to a node in the cache - This contains the model's name and unique ID.

## High level overview

We turn the data on the backend into a list of `CacheNode`'s and a list of `Reference<T>`'s and then return it to the frontend.

We insert the `CacheNode`'s into a global cache on the frontend and then use the `Reference<T>`'s to reconstruct the data by looking up the `CacheNode`'s.

When the cache changes (from another query, invalidation, etc), we can reconstruct *all* queries using their `Reference<T>`'s to reflect the updated data.


## Rust usage

The Rust helpers are defined [here](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/blob/main/crates/cache/src/lib.rs) and can be used like the following:

```rust
pub struct Demo {
	id: String,
}

impl sd_cache::Model for Demo {
	// The name + the ID *must* refer to a unique node.
	// If your using an enum, the variant should show up in the ID (although this isn't possible right now)
	fn name() -> &'static str {
		"Demo"
	}
}

let data: Vec<Demo> = vec![];

// We normalised the data but splitting it into a group of reference and a group of `CacheNode`'s.
let (nodes, items) = libraries.normalise(|i| i.id);

// `NormalisedResults` or `NormalisedResult` are optional wrapper types to hold a one or multiple items and their cache nodes.
// You don't have to use them, but they save declaring a bunch of identical structs.
//
// Alternatively add `nodes: Vec<CacheNode>` and `items: Vec<Reference<T>>` to your existing return type.
//
return sd_cache::NormalisedResults { nodes, items };
```

## Typescript usage

The Typescript helpers are defined [here](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/blob/main/packages/client/src/cache.tsx).

### Usage with React

We have helpers designed for easy usage within React's lifecycle.

```ts
const query = useLibraryQuery([...]);

// This will inject all the models into the cache
useNodes(query.data?.nodes);

// This will reconstruct the data from the cache
const data = useCache(query.data?.item);

console.log(data);
```

### Vanilla JS

These API's are really useful for special cases. In general aim to use the React API's unless you have a good reason for these.

```ts
const cache = useNormalisedCache(); // Get the cache within the react context

// Pass `cache` outside React (Eg. `useEffect`, `onSuccess`, etc)

const data = ...;

// This will inject all the models into the cache
cache.withNodes(data.nodes)

// This will reconstruct the data from the cache
//
// *WARNING* This is not reactive. So any changes to the nodes will not be reflected.
//Â Using this is fine if you need to quickly check the data but don't hold onto it.
const data = useCache(query.data?.item);

console.log(data);
```

## Design decisions

### Why `useNodes` and `useCache`?

This was done to make the system super flexible with what data you can return from your backend.

For example the backend doesn't just have to return `NormalisedResults` or `NormalisedResult`, it could return:

```rust
pub struct AllTheData {
	file_paths: Vec<Reference<FilePath>>,
	locations: Vec<Reference<Location>>,
	nodes: Vec<CacheNode>
}
```

and then on the frontend you could do the following:

```ts
const query = useQuery([...]);
useNodes(query.data?.nodes);
const locations = useCache(query.data?.locations);
const filePaths = useCache(query.data?.file_paths);
```

This is only possible because `useNodes` and `useCache` take in a specific key, instead of the whole `data` object, so you can tell it where to look.


## Known issues

### Specta support

Expressing `Reference<T>` in Specta is really hard so we [surgically update](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/blob/a315dd632da8175b47f9e0713d3c7fc470329352/core/src/api/mod.rs#L219) it's [type definition](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/blob/a315dd632da8175b47f9e0713d3c7fc470329352/crates/cache/src/lib.rs#L215).

This is done using `rspc::Router::sd_patch_types_dangerously` which is a method specific to our fork [spacedrive/rspc](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/rspc).

### Invalidation system integration

The initial implementation of this idea with an MVP. It works with the existing invalidation system like regular queries, but the invalidation system isn't aware of the normalised cache like a better implementation would be.
