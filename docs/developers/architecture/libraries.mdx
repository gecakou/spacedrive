# Libraries

A library is the database that Spacedrive stores all file structures and metadata. It can be synchronized with other [Nodes]().

To learn how data is synchronized check out the documentation on [Sync](/docs/developers/architecture/sync).

Libraries can be encrypted with a passphrase set by the user.
