# Virtual Distributed Filesystem (VDFS)

Spacedrive is a virtual distributed filesystem, but what exactly is that?

A virtual filesystem is simply a layer of abstraction between a physical filesystem and the user. A distributed filesystem is a filesystem that is spread across multiple machines. A virtual distributed filesystem is a filesystem that is spread across multiple machines, but appears to the user as a single filesystem.

## How it works

Spacedrive defines a VDFS under the following data model; A Library, Nodes, Volumes, Locations, Paths and Objects.

A node is a single machine running the VDFS software, it syncronizes a CRDT based database, called the Library, with other nodes in the network. The library consists of Locations, found on Volumes, which contain Paths to files on the underlying filesystem.
