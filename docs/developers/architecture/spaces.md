# Spaces

Spaces are virtual folders that can be shared publicly on the internet, or privately with friends, family and teams. Spaces contain [Objects](/docs/developers/architecture/objects) which can be physically stored on any connected Node, or by Spacedrive as a service. Objects can be organized and presented spatially, with various layouts and variable grid placements. Color theme, icon packs and typography can be customized per Space.

Objects can be added to a Space manually, or by matching a defined ruleset, similar to Tags.

Spacedrive comes with pre-defined Spaces, such as: photos, videos, screenshots, documents.
