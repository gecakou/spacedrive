# Database

### Schema

Our data schema is defined using Prisma, you can [view it on GitHub](https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive/blob/main/core/prisma/schema.prisma).

### Prisma Client Rust

We use Prisma Client Rust as a database ORM, it allows us to use Prisma to define our schema and generate migrations based on modifications to that schema.

### Migrations

Migrations are run by the Prisma migration engine on app launch.

### Database file

The databases file is SQLite and can be opened in any SQL viewer.
