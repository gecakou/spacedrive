Photo albums shouldn’t be stuck in a device\n\t\t\t\t\tecosystem, or harvested for advertising data. They should be OS agnostic,\n\t\t\t\t\tpermanent and personally owned. Data we create is our legacy, that will long\n\t\t\t\t\toutlive us—open source technology is the only way to ensure we retain absolute\n\t\t\t\t\tcontrol over the data that defines our lives, at unlimited scale.",
